## Troubleshooting

### Heart Rate Monitor Not Connecting

Ryval works with any standard Bluetooth heart rate monitor (e.g. Polar, Wahoo, Garmin, Coospo).

1. Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your device.
2. Ensure the heart rate monitor is powered on and not connected to another app.
3. Open Ryval > Settings > Heart Rate Monitor > Scan for Devices.
4. Select your device from the list and tap Connect.
5. If the monitor still won't connect, try restarting Bluetooth or your phone.

### Health Connect Not Working

1. Make sure Health Connect is installed on your device (available from the Google Play Store).
2. Open Ryval > Settings > Health Connect > Connect.
3. Grant the requested permissions when prompted.
4. If the permission dialog doesn't appear, go to Android Settings > Apps > Health Connect > Permissions and manually grant access to Ryval.

### Workout Data Not Saving

- Make sure you tap "Finish Workout" at the end of your session. Closing the app mid-workout may result in lost data.
- If the app was running in the background, your workout timer and data should be preserved when you return.

### Backup and Restore

- **Create a backup**: Settings > Data > Download My Data.
- **Restore from backup**: Settings > Data > Restore From Backup, then select your backup JSON file.
- **Automatic backups**: Settings > Data > Auto-Backup. Choose a frequency and backup folder.
