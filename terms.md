# Terms of Service

<p class="subtitle">Effective date: February 16, 2026</p>

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Ryval mobile application ("the App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.

## Use of the App

Ryval is a personal fitness tracking application. The App is provided for informational and personal fitness tracking purposes only. It is **not** a medical device and does **not** provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

You agree to:

- Use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.
- Provide accurate information when setting up your profile (weight, height, birth year, sex), as this data is used for calorie and fitness calculations.
- Not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or tamper with the App.

## Health and Fitness Disclaimer

The App may display heart rate data, calorie estimates, fitness scores, and other metrics. These are **estimates only** and should not be relied upon for medical decisions.

- Calorie calculations are based on published formulas (Keytel 2005, MET tables) and may not be accurate for all individuals.
- Heart rate data depends on the accuracy of your connected sensor.
- Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before starting or modifying any exercise program.
- If you experience pain, dizziness, or discomfort during exercise, stop immediately and seek medical attention.

## Accounts and Authentication

- The App offers optional sign-in via anonymous authentication or email magic links through Firebase.
- You are responsible for maintaining access to the email address associated with your account.
- We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

## Your Data

- Your workout data, heart rate logs, and body composition data are stored **locally on your device**.
- You are responsible for backing up your data. The App provides manual and automatic backup features, but we do not guarantee against data loss.
- See our [Privacy Policy]({{ '/privacy' | relative_url }}) for details on how data is collected and stored.

## Intellectual Property

The App and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by the developer and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the App.

## Third-Party Services

The App integrates with third-party services including:

- **Firebase** (authentication and social features)
- **OneSignal** (push notifications)
- **Android Health Connect** (body composition data)
- **Bluetooth heart rate monitors** (e.g., Polar H10)

Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or conduct of third-party services.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.

We are not liable for:

- Any injury, health issue, or adverse outcome arising from exercise performed while using the App.
- Inaccurate calorie, heart rate, or fitness calculations.
- Loss of data, including workout history, due to device failure, app updates, or other causes.
- Interruptions in service or connectivity with Bluetooth devices or Health Connect.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## Termination

You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it. Uninstalling removes all locally stored data.

We may discontinue the App or restrict access at any time without prior notice.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the App shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
